It's a three-day event consisting of a Keynote presentation, sessions, codelabs, and sandboxes. Temporary structures housing all of the event components, along with shade canopies, food tents, downtime activities and shareable monuments, are organized along a central boulevard through the site. Sandboxes are hands-on product and technology demo exhibits, each within either a geodesic dome, tent, or inflatable structure. In 2019, there were eight Sandbox structures, each developed in close partnership between Google product teams and the design team at Sparks.",
